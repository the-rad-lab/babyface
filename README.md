# BabyFace

The code for the machine-augmented costume used in the "Baby Face" performance

An Arduino Uno Board is used as the microcontroller to control the components. The wings in the suit can either be controlled tactilely using two buttons (one each for slow and fast movement of the wings) or somatically using the FSR sensor as a breath sensor. The system parameters in the code are tunable to the performers liking. 

### Input Components
1. Force-Sensitive Resistor (FSR)
2. Left Flex Sensor
3. Right Flex Sensor
4. Two Buttons for Manual mode (slow and fast)

### Output Components
1. Left Wing
2. Right Wing
3. 8x8 NeoPixel Matrix (optional)
4. NeoPixel LED Strip

#### TODO
- Add wings schematics
- Make code more object oriented
